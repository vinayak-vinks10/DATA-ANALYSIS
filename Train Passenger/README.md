# 🚆 Train Passenger Data Analysis (Python & Pandas)

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a **500+ record train passenger dataset** to uncover insights related to passenger behavior, revenue generation, booking trends, and operational performance.  
It follows an **industry-style data analysis workflow** from raw data to actionable insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw passenger data  
- Analyze trains, routes, classes, and revenue patterns  
- Study booking behavior, payment preferences, and cancellations  
- Generate insights useful for business and decision-making  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Size:** 520 passenger records  
- **Key Columns:**  
  PassengerID, Age, Gender, TrainNo, Source, Destination, Class, TicketPrice,  
  BookingDate, TravelDate, PaymentMode, BookingStatus  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV / Excel** for reporting  

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Data Loading & Understanding  
2. Data Cleaning (missing values, duplicates, data types)  
3. Feature Engineering (advance booking days, booking month)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis  
5. Visualization  
6. Insights & Reporting  

---

## 📊 Key Analysis
- Train-wise & route-wise passenger and revenue analysis  
- Class-wise passenger distribution and revenue contribution  
- Payment mode usage and booking status analysis  
- Monthly booking trends and peak season identification  
- Outlier detection (high ticket prices, extreme age groups)  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- **Sleeper class** has the highest passenger count, while **AC classes generate higher revenue per passenger**  
- A **small set of trains and routes contributes a major share of total revenue**  
- **UPI** is the most commonly used payment method  
- Most bookings are **confirmed**, with a relatively low cancellation rate  
- Passengers book tickets **~1 month in advance on average**  
- Clear **seasonal trends** observed in monthly bookings
